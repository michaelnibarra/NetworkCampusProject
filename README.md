<h1>Network Design Campus Project</h1>

 ### [Network Design Project - Video](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OigxLNqqQKlDeX-7y5lH99wM3HYxBqipPWfm5VGRkvw/edit)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project requires you to design, cost, and describe an industrial network architecture that is designed to implement the need described as Campus Facility. I followed the redundant star topology to help with the intentional duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the goal of increasing reliability of the system, usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe, or to improve actual system performance. Essentially if one switch fails it would still have the second multilayer switch to function. I found this project to be very repetitive and tedious work applying the OT devices and network topology structure. Essentially I focused on making Building A to the best of my ability, knowing if I did that correctly they would all follow the same layout.
